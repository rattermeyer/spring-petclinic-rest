# ADR Review Template

## General Review

* [ ] Is the problem relevant enough to be solved and recorded in an ADR?
  * if you discussed an issue with 3 or more team members for more than 15 min it might be worth documenting it
* [ ] Do the options have a chance to solve the problem? Are valid options missing?
  * Have at least two alternatives been identified and investigated?
* [ ] Are the decision drivers (criteria) mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive?
* [ ] If the criteria conflict with each other, are they prioritized?
* [ ] Does the chosen solution solve the problem? Is the decision rationale sound and convincing?
* [ ] Are the positive and negative consequences of the solution options reported as objectively as possible?
* [ ] Is the chosen solution described in an actionable way? Can it be traced back to requirements?
* [ ] Does the ADR define a validity period or review date?

## Standards compliance

* [ ] Is the decision in conflict with general eurodata guidelines?
* [ ] Has the ADR been discussed with the eurodata enterprise architects?
* [ ] Has the ADR been accepted as reasonable in this situation?
